| Mutable default argument (`logs=[]`)           | **Pylint**          | Bug                        | 8       | Using a mutable list as a default argument causes shared data between calls.     | Changed default to `None` and initialized inside the function (`if logs is None: logs = []`). |
| Use of `eval()`                                | **Bandit**          | Security                   | 59      | `eval()` can execute arbitrary code, creating a security vulnerability.          | Replaced `eval()` with `ast.literal_eval()` for safe parsing of expressions.                  |
| File opened without context manager (`open()`) | **Pylint**          | Resource / Maintainability | 26, 32  | Files were opened using `open()` without `with`, which can cause resource leaks. | Used `with open(..., encoding="utf-8")` for safe and automatic file closing.                  |
| Bare `except:`                                 | **Flake8 / Pylint** | Code Smell / Logic         | 19      | Catching all exceptions hides real errors and makes debugging hard.              | Replaced with `except Exception:` or specific error types.                                    |
| Trailing whitespace                            | **Flake8**          | Style                      | 3       | Unnecessary trailing spaces after code lines.                                    | Removed trailing spaces.                                                                      |
